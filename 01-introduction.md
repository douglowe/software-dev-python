::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This course follows on from the python introduction course. To ensure that we are starting from similar positions, there follows a short multiple choice quiz on key python concepts that we will be building on through this course.

## Variables and Lists

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 1\. Assigning a value to a variable

We wish to store the string `Cat` as a value in the variable `animal`, which of these lines of code will do this for us?

1. `animal = 'Cat'`
2. `animal = Cat`
3. `Cat = animal`
4. `animal(Cat)`

:::::::::::::::  solution

Answer 1 is correct

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 2\. Assigning values to a list

We wish to create a list of values, which of these lines of code is valid to do this?

1. `varlist = [34, 57, '2d']`
2. `varlist = (12, 'vr', 95)`
3. `varlist = 'xcf', 12, 97`

:::::::::::::::  solution

Answer 1 is correct

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 3a. Indexing characters in a string

Lists and strings both contain multiple indexed values (in the case of strings these are specifically individual characters rather than other values). If we have a variable `animal` which contains the string `penguin`, which of these options will print the first character (`p`) for us?

1. `print(animal[0])`
2. `print(animal[1])`
3. `print(animal['p'])`

:::::::::::::::  solution

Answer 1 is correct

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 3b. Indexing characters in a string (slicing)

We can also select whole sections of lists and strings, not just single elements. Using the same variable `animal`, containing the string `penguin`, as above, which of these options will print the last 2 characters for us? (Note that there is more an one correct answer)

1. `print(animal[5:])`
2. `print(animal[6:])`
3. `print(animal[6:7])`
4. `print(animal[5:7])`
5. `print(animal[-2:])`
6. `print(animal[:-2])`

:::::::::::::::  solution

Answers 1, 4, and 5 are correct

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Loops

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 4\. Constructing a `for` loop

Please write a simple `for` loop which will print out each of the characters in the `animal` variable one at a time.

:::::::::::::::  solution

```python
for char in animal:
    print(char)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Software Modules

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 5\. Loading new functions

We want to use the functions in the `numpy` library in our code. How do we open this library in our code?

1. `import numpy`
2. `load numpy`
3. `open numpy`

:::::::::::::::  solution

Answer 1 is correct

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## If statements and conditionals

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 6\. Conditionals

Which of these conditional tests returns a `True` result?

1. `4 > 3`
2. `'a' != 'b'`
3. `6 >= 6.0`
4. `'3' == 3`
5. `3 > 'c'`

:::::::::::::::  solution

Answers 1, 2, and 3 return `True` results. 4 returns `False`. 5 raises an Error.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### 7\. If statements

What is printed when this `if` statement is used?

```python
if 4 > 5:
    print('A')
elif 4 <= 5:
    print('B')
elif 4 < 5:
    print('C')
else:
    print('D')
```

1. `A`
2. `B`
3. `C`
4. `B` and `C`
5. `D`
6. `A` and `D`

:::::::::::::::  solution

`B`. Both `4 <= 5` and `4 < 5` would return a `True` result, but the `if` statement is exited as soon as the `True` result is returned.

## Formatting Variables and Objects in Strings

Throughout this course, we will be printing the values of variables inside strings to demonstrate what the code does. There are a number of ways to this in Python; in this course we will be using `f-strings` which are the recommended string interpolation syntax from version 3.6 onwards.

To use `f-strings` simply start a string literal with `f` or `F`, then embed whatever you want interpolating into the string within curly braces `{}`:

```python
two_int = 2
two_str = "2"
f_string = f"{two_int} + {two_str} = {2 + 2}"
print(f_string)
```
```output
2 + 2 = 4
```

Numerical values can be formatted using `:` inside the curly braces. For example, an integer `i` can be made to have a width `n` using `{i:nd}`, or `{i:0nd}` to pad it out with zeros:

```python
print(f"One with four leading spaces {1:5d}")
print(f"One with four leading zeros {1:05d}")
```
```output
One with four leading spaces     1
One with four leading zeros 00001
```

Floating point variables can have their precision specified with a number after a decimal point and an `f`:
```python
pi = 3.141592653589793
print(pi)
print(f"pi to three decimal places is {pi:.3f}")
```
```output
3.141592653589793
pi to three decimal places is 3.142
```

Or made to use scientific notation with an `e`:

```python
print(1e9)
print(f"A billion in scientific notation is {1e9:.1e}")
```
```output
1000000000.0
A billion in scientific notation is 1.0e+09
```

This is only scratching the surface of what you can do with `f-strings`, they are often the most powerful and concise way to format variables inside strings. However, there are occasions when other methods are preferable, and you should be careful using them with Python [before version 3.12](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#upgrading-f-strings-python-312-and-beyond).

## Generative AI

We would like to reiterate the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) stance on [Generative AI in coding](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-intro.html#generative-ai) which you may have seen when preparing for this course.

To summarise the position, the recommendation is that you **avoid** getting help from generative AI during the workshop for several reasons:

 - For most problems you will encounter at this stage, help and answers can be found among the first results returned by searching the internet or looking on e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions).
 - The foundational knowledge and skills you will learn in this lesson by writing and fixing your own programs are essential to be able to evaluate the correctness and safety of any code you receive from online help or a generative AI chatbot. If you choose to use these tools in the future, the expertise you gain from learning and practising these fundamentals on your own will help you use them more effectively.
 - As you continue programming, the mistakes you make will be the kinds that have also been made – and overcome! – by everybody else who learned to program before you. Since these mistakes and the questions you are likely to have at this stage are common, they are also better represented than other, more specialised problems and tasks in the data that was used to train generative AI tools. This means that a generative AI chatbot is more likely to produce accurate responses to questions that novices ask, which could give you a false impression of how reliable they will be when you are ready to do things that are more advanced.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Assign values to variables using `=`
- Generate lists using square brackets `[]`
- Use indexes inside `[]`, starting at 0, to select characters from strings and items from lists
- Use `for` to loop through items in iterable objects
- Make conditional expressions using `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=`
- Use `f'{}'` to embed formatted variables inside strings
- Avoid use of generative AI for this course
